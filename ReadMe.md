# Read Me

This is a collection of notes and examples for my TypeScript learning. The main course I am taking right now is TypeScript:the developer's guide [2020] from Udemy by Stephen Grider

## Required local installations

While every folder / example contains package.json I wanna write the total list of packages and installations done for these studies

- VS Code (editor, prettier: extension)
- npm (Node Package Manager, installed bundled with Node.JS)
- nodemon
- concurrently
- typescript (from npm)
- ts-node (from npm)
- parcel-bundler (I have it installed globally)
- faker
- @types/faker
- @types/googlemaps
- json-server (global install)
- axios (local install for web app)
